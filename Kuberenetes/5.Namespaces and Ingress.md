* The namespace is a organising concept where we can use it to organise the resources in a standard manner.

* The kubernetes-dashboard is the minikube specific. The kube-system is for the system process and we should not edit it.
* The kube-public is public one and available to anyone and has a config map.
* The kube-node-lease is for the heartbeats of the nodes and the lease of the resources of the namespaces.
* We can create a namespace using the `kubectl create namespace NAME`
* We can create a namespace using a configuration file also. The main need of the namespace is the grouping of resources in the namespace.
* The clustering of the resources in a single namespace like default is a problem where we cannot monitor in a effective manner.
* We can create namespaces in the types like the services, deployments, secrets,etc. So we can organise the resources in a namespaces.
* We can avoid the name problems in the deployment, services,etc as sometimes we overwrote the same deployment name.
* We can have staging and development resource sharing using the namespaces.
* We can also limit the resources of the namespaces so we can utilise the resources in good manner.
* There are some downsides also like we cannot use the resources of one namespace from another namespace completely.
* If we have a secret or a config map we should have it in both the namespace if the both refer to same resource also.
* But we can access services from the other namespaces using the namespace name after the service name for example `data_base_service.database`.
* We can add an resource to an namespace by using the flag `--namespace=NAME`. For example: `kubectl apply -f config.yaml --namespace=my-namespace`.
* Or we can just give the namespace a parameter in the config file itself in the metadata part.
* We can use a tool called kubens to change the active namespace in the cluster.
# Ingress:
* If we want to access the application from outside of the cluster we can use the external service and a public IP address. But this is not an convenient method to follow.
* So we use a internal service called the ingress to open a opening in the cluster.
* The config file of the ingress is also like the
