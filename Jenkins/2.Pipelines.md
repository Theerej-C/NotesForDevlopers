- Jenkins Pipeline (or simply "Pipeline" with a capital "P") is a suite of plugins which supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.
- A Continuous Delivery Pipeline is an automated expression of your process for getting software from version control right through to your user and customer.
- Pipeline in the Jenkins provide the extensible tool set for modelling simple to complex delivery pipelines `as code` via `Pipeline Domain-Specific-Language(DSL` syntax.
- The definition of Jenkins pipeline is written into a text file named `Jenkinsfile` just like `Dockerfile` where the `pipeline-as-code` is the concept where we can control the version and do the job.
- A `Jenkinsfile` can be written in two types of syntax:
	1. Declarative
	2. Scripted.

- Defintions:
	- Pipeline: A Pipeline is a user-defined model of a CD pipeline. A Pipelineâ€™s code defines your entire build process, which typically includes stages for building an application, testing it and then delivering it. It is the key part of the declarative pipeline syntax.
