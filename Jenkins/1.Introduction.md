- The Jenkins is an CI/CD platform which is the process of Continuous Integeration and Continuous Deployment. Where the CI means multiple people working in the same project in an continuous manner.
- Where the CD means we can continuously deploy the application in the server. As there are many tools the Jenkins has an unique advantage like plugins (More than 100 plugins). 
- To use the Jenkins we need the java in the machine to use the Jenkins. Then the daemon will start and the admin page will be in the port 8080. Use the install the default plugins so that no problem in there.
- Jenkins is an automation platform which allows us to build, test and deploy software's in an automated manner using pipelines. We can automate anything using the Jenkins and then it provides a Web GUI to do these things. 
## Infrastructures:
- The infrastructure is an simple one where the master server which controls the pipelines and schedule builds and then the agents/minions are the one which performs the tasks.
