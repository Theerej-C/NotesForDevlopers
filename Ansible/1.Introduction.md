- The main purpose of the ansible is to provision servers where the scale of the servers can be any big. This automates as many servers as we want. The ansible control host which will the control of the server. The connection is the SSH mode from the controller to the server.
- The ansible control host can be anything like the laptop or anything. So maximum we need to have the code in the git for collaboration.
- Open SSH is the tool which is used in the ansible to connect to others where the key management is an important one.
## OPEN SSH:
- There are two types of authentication in the SSH the password based, Key based where the key based will automatically logs you in but the password requires pass. Then the key based is the more secure than the password based.
- The first point is that open SSH should be installed in the workstations and the servers. The open SSH is the way which the ansible is installed.
- Then we should connect the servers from the machine where we give the yes to the prompt which is only one time. We can create the SSH key pair for the normal user. Then we can use a new SSH ansible keys also.
