* `git diff`: Displays the changes made between the current version and the previous version. 
* `git diff --cached`: Displays the changes made between the current version and the version stored in the cache.( staged changes )
* `git diff --staged`: Displays the changes made between the current version and the version that is staged for the next commit. 
* `git diff --interactive`: Allows you to interactively select which changes to include in your next commit.
* The git diff main purpose is to see the changes in the files in the current repo. It checks for the staged one and indexed one.

* The main point to note is that as the commit always commit the changes in the place of the index so the git diff --staged is the thing which commits in the commit.
 `git diff`
git diff shows the difference between your working directory and the index. 
`git diff commit`
This form summarizes the differences between your working directory and the
given commit. 
`git diff - -cached commit`
This command shows the differences between the staged changes in the index and
the given commit. 
If the option --cached doesnâ€™t make sense to you, perhaps the synonym --staged
will. It is available in Git version 1.6.1 and later.
`git diff commit1 commit2`
If you specify two arbitrary commits, the command displays the differences between the two. 
* There are git diff ranges like the git log. But the operation of the git diff is completely different.
* The git diff completely checks all the files from the one commit till all the commits between the range of the commits and tell the difference.

* This shows what are the files which are changed from the HEAD commit of branch new to the commit SHA cae...
## Merge
* The joining of a content of one branch to another branch is the merging of two branches. The main command is the *git merge branch name* where we should be present in the parent branch to have a merge in that branch.
* If there are problems in the merge it is known as the merge conflict. The merge conflict will appear mostly when  there are branches which has a change in the same line of a same line at different commits.
* We can use the git status or the *git ls-files -u* to locate the unmerged things and the conflicts between them.

* *git diff* will also produce a clear picture of the conflict in the command line.
* In git log command there are options to explore the merge conflicts in a effective manner.
* --merge will be used to show the commits with only the merge conflict in it.

  * We should note that left id ours side and the right is the their side because the branch which accepts the merge is the ours branch and the branch which is being merged is the right side.
  * So the --left-right displays which side the merge conflict happened.
  * Then the -p flag will show the patches involved in that.
  * If we went into a merge conflict until we clear it we cannot go to other branches. But to force withdrawal of the merge is that we can use the *git reset --hard HEAD* to reset the HEAD to the commit prior to the merge commit.
