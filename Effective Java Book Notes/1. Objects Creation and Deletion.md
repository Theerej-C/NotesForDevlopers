* Normally a class will provide a constructor for the object building but there is a static facatory method to do the same thing. For Example:
```
public static Boolean valueOf(boolean b){
    return b?Boolean.TRUE:Boolean.False;
}
```
* This translates boolean primitive to Boolean object reference.
* There are many advantages to the static factory methods:
    1. Unlike constructors they have names.
    2. Unlike constructor they are not required to create a new object each time they are invoked.
    3. Unlike constructors thet can return an object of any subtype of their return type.
