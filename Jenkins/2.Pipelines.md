- Jenkins Pipeline (or simply "Pipeline" with a capital "P") is a suite of plugins which supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.
- A Continuous Delivery Pipeline is an automated expression of your process for getting software from version control right through to your user and customer.
- Pipeline in the Jenkins provide the extensible tool set for modelling simple to complex delivery pipelines `as code` via `Pipeline Domain-Specific-Language(DSL` syntax.
- The definition of Jenkins pipeline is written into a text file named `Jenkinsfile` just like `Dockerfile` where the `pipeline-as-code` is the concept where we can control the version and do the job.
- A `Jenkinsfile` can be written in two types of syntax:
	1. Declarative
	2. Scripted.
- ![[Pasted image 20240522080527.png]] This is a flow chart which shows how the CD is performed and designed in the Jenkins Pipeline.
- Definitions:
	- Pipeline: A Pipeline is a user-defined model of a CD pipeline. A Pipelineâ€™s code defines your entire build process, which typically includes stages for building an application, testing it and then delivering it. It is the key part of the declarative pipeline syntax.
	- Node: A node is a machine which is the part of the Jenkins environment and is capable of executing pipelines. Node is for the Scripted pipeline syntax.
	- Stage: A stage is a block defines a conceptually distinct subset of tasks performed through the entire Pipeline.
	- Step: A single task fundamentally a step tells Jenkins what to do at a particular point in time.
## Pipeline Syntax:
- Declarative:
```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                //
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                //
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                //
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- Scripted:
```
node {
    stage('Build') {
        //
    }
    stage('Test') {
        //
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
        //
    }
}
```
- Example pipeline:
```
pipeline {
    agent any
    options {
        skipStagesAfterUnstable()
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'make'
            }
        }
        stage('Test'){
            steps {
                sh 'make check'
                junit 'reports/**/*.xml'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'make publish'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- A pipeline can be created in mainly three ways : `Through Blue Oceans`, ` Through Classic UI`, `In the Source Control Manager(SCM)`. Where the best practises is that the using a `Jenkinsfile` and using the source control like the git.
- In blue ocean and direct `SCM` there is a secure way of handling the `Jenkinsfile` so that the configuration will be source controlled but the direct classical `UI` is not a best practise. The documentation for the pipeline will be inbuilt in the Jenkins itself in the `{JenkinsURL}/pipeline-syntax`
- There are Global variables in the Jenkins which can be used to find information's like `currentBuild` which gives information's like result, display name, etc.
## Jenkins file:
- The Jenkins file make our life easier as we configure all the stages in the file itself. There are mainly three stages:
	- build
	- test
	- deploy
- Other than these stages we can add as many as we want so that the project comes as we needed for example we can add a containerisation stage after the build or test stage.
- There are many environment variables are already available for the Jenkins and also we can create the variables manually also. We can see the Jenkins variables in `{JenkinsURL}/pipeline-syntax/globals#env`
- In declarative syntax we can use the `environment` directive for the environment variable declaration. For example inside the `stage` directive we can mention. Not only inside the stage we can also declare it inside the pipeline itself.
```
environment {
	DEBUG_FLAGS = "-g"
}
```
- We can dynamically write the environment variable in the run time with the same directive like: Here the script from the sh command will give the environment a name.
```
environment {
	CC = """${sh(
		returnStdout: true,
		script: 'echo "clang"'
	)}"""
}
```
- Credential management is an crucial step in the Jenkins where we will use the credentials in the Jenkins file. The `credential` helper function will help us to simplify the job so that we can do it flexibly.
- When we store a credential in the credential manger we can access it like:
```
environment {
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     = credentials('jenkins-aws-secret-key-id')
        AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = credentials('jenkins-aws-secret-access-key')
    }
```
- So the `credential` helper will be useful for the secret text, username and password, secret file. but if we have other credentials we need to go in another route.
- Then there should be careful handling of the credentials in the strings because when `'hello ${boy}'` will show the same as output in console but when we use the double quotes it will interpolate the credentials to the sentence and the console will show us.
- So when we had other credentials like SSH or the passphrase like things we use the snippet generator. Where we use the `withCredentials: Bind crdentials to variables` option.
- After the snippet is generated we can paste it in the Jenkinsfile:
```
steps {
        withCredentials(bindings: [sshUserPrivateKey(credentialsId: 'jenkins-ssh-key-for-abc', \ keyFileVariable: 'SSH_KEY_FOR_ABC')]) {
                  // 
                }
```
- We can set parameters in a default manner in the declarative pipeline as there is a `parameter` directive:
```
agents any
parameters {
	string(name:'Greetings', defaultValue: 'Hello', description:'Hello form user')
}
```
- Handling failures in the Jenkins declarative pipeline is very easy as it provides a post section which has `post conditions` like `always,unstable,success,failure,changed`. We can set different scripts for different conditions like:
```
 post {
        always {
            junit '**/target/*.xml'
        }
        failure {
            mail to: team@example.com, subject: 'The Pipeline failed :('
        }
    }
```
- We can use multiple agents in the pipeline multiple steps using the `agent` directive like:
```
stage('Build') {
	agent {
		label 'linux'
	}
	// other code.
}
```
- The pipeline syntax option in the pipeline is the thing to access when we want the generators like snippets, directives like cron job etc.

## Docker in Jenkins:
- We can use a docker container as as agent in the pipeline like mentioning the image name of the container to it.
```
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker { image 'node:20.11.1-alpine3.19' }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'node --version'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- But for this we need two plugins `Docker and Docker Pipeline` so that the build run in a clean manner.
- Then we need to add the `jenkins` user to the `docker` group so that it has the permission to use the docker using the `sudo usermod -aG docker jenkins`
