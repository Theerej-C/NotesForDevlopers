- The bash is the basic shell in maximum all the debian systems.
- There are shell utilities and many features in the bash.
- The -r is for restricted mode which restrict user to the current directory.
- We can use the ; to nest the commands in single line. This will execute the commands in the same shell
- But when we use () around all the commands it will run in different child shell.

-  The background mode is one of an important function which can used for the multiprocessing.
- If we want a command to run in a background mode use the & sign at end of command which gives you a process id.
- The jobs command is used to get all the jobs running in the background.
- We can also use the () to stack up the commands using ; and use the & for the background of all the process.
- The background process is not the only way. There is a command named coproc which runs a subshell in background in a coop level.
- We can use the coproc to set a bunch of commands into single process using single name. The main thing is the space between paranthesis is important.
- To find where the command resides we use the where and command name or the type -a with command name.
- Whenever a external command is ran it creates a child process. When using a built-in command, no forking is required. Therefore, built-in commands are less expensive.
- The history command is an useful one which stores the history of the commands we typed.
- We can also use !! To get the previous command and run it.
- The -a flag of the history command is used to manually save the history file in .bash_history
- We can refer to any history command using ! and number of the command in history command

- Environment Variables:

- The printenv or env is the command to see the global env variables.
- The set command is used to list the local env variables and also the global ones.
- We can set local variables using simple syntax of varname=value. But when the value contains spaces use the quotes.
- We can use the unset command to remove the variables.
- The /etc/profile is an automatic startup program or environment program which runs and sets the executable directories and it is the main one.
- We should not edit atmost in any situation
- We should try to use the .bashrc or other things for other shells for other startup files.
- The /etc/profile file is the main default startup file for the bash shell on the system.
- The zsh has the zprofile inside zsh dir in the etc. And when we see the content of it just emulates the bash profile.
- The profile.d directory in the etc folder is where the application related startup files will be presented.
- The three user defined startup files are

- $HOME/.bash_profile
- $HOME/.bash_login
- $HOME/.profile

- The .bashrc will be started by any one of these three startups
- The best idea for persistent environment variables are having a .sh file in the profile.d directory in the etc directory.
- We can store the env variables in an array.
