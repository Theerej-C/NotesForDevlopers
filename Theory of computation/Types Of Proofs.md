- There are many types of proofs in the dimension of mathematics and science.
	- Proof by Construction:
		- Many theorem tells a object exist so when we can prove the construction of object we can prove the existence.
		- Many problems in the graph theory are proved by this proof method.
	- Proof by contradiction:
		- Here we say that theorem is false and try to prove this statement is false.
	- Proof by Induction:
		- It is an advanced method to show that every element in a particular infinite set have a special property.
		- In induction proof the assumption is called as induction hypothesis.
