- View is an type of special table which is not a real table but gets values and rows from a real table. 
- Views are used to separate some columns or data from a table for some time usage as if we use another table for same data it would be bad.
```
create view customer_view as
select customer_first, customer_last
from customer;
```
- We can do all the operation like in the real table in the view. View can be deleted by the `drop`. `drop view customer_view`.
## INDEX:
- Indexes are used to find values within a specific column more quickly. It is a BTree data structure. As MySQL searches a column in a sequential manner so it will be expensive so we need the index.
- When we use index on an column then the `select` will take less time but `update` will take more time.
- To show indexes of a table use the command `show index from customer`. To apply an index to an column we use the `create` command.
```
create index last_name_index
on customer(customer_last);
```
- We can have a multi column indexes as sometimes we need the combination of two columns:
```
create index last_name_first_name
on customer(customer_last,customer_first);
```
- We can drop an index by the `alter` command `alter table customer drop index last_name`.
## SUB QUERIES:
- A subquery is a query within a query which is used to combine queries for complex problems like selecting the average and also the names of an employee, etc.
```
select employee_first_name, employee_last_name,hourly_pay,
(select avg(hourly_pay) from employee_table) as avg
from employee_table;
```
```
select customer_first, customer_last
from customer
where customer_id in
(select distinct customer_id 
from transactions
where customer_id is not null)
```
