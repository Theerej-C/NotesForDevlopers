- View is an type of special table which is not a real table but gets values and rows from a real table. 
- Views are used to separate some columns or data from a table for some time usage as if we use another table for same data it would be bad.
```
create view customer_view as
select customer_first, customer_last
from customer;
```
- We can do all the operation like in the real table in the view. View can be deleted by the `drop`. `drop view customer_view`.
