- The `bin`  for the binaries where the GNU level utilities are stored. The `dev` is for device nodes. The `etc` is for system configuration files. The `mnt` is for the mount directory.
- The `proc` is for the process directory . The `run` is for the run time directory. The `srv` is for the service. The `usr` is for the user binary
- `Cd` is the command for the directory changing and pwd is for the seeing present work directory.
- The `ls` is for the listing the files and the directories
- The `-F` is for the distinguished listing. The `-a` is for showing all the directory.
- The `-R` is for the recurssive option which can be combined with anything.
- The `-l` is for the long list which is used for the extra informations.
- The ls `-i` is an important ls command to see the inode number of files which is allocated by the kernel.
- The `?` In the search name of the ls command will get all the files with the same name name and any character instead of question mark
- ![[Pasted image 20240107120849.png]]
- Then the `*` is for any  number of characters.
- The pattern matching can be used in the ls commands to find specified ones. The files can be created by touch and also many commands.
- For copying files we use the `cp` command with file and destination
- It is best practice's to add a `-i` in cp which will prompt a warning of override
- The `-R` is very useful in cp which recursively copy the content of the directory.
- If the destination directory is not present cp will create a new one
## Linking Files:
- We can use the links to have many virtual copies of a files instead f physical copy. A link is a placeholder in a directory that points to the real location of the file. In symbolic links the data is not shared but the file will point to the parent file like pointing only.
- ![[Pasted image 20240107120917.png]]
- The symbolic link can be created only with uncreated file only. The hard link is creating a copy of the file exactly same but different name.
- The inode number of file1 and file5 are same. Don't use the cp in linked files instead use another link to the copying file.
- There is no rename in the Linux it is just moving the file. We use the `mv` command to move the content of a file to another named content. The mv only affects the file name not the inode or the time.
- The `rm` is for the removing the files and the directories. The `-f` parameter is for the force removal in rm
- ![[Pasted image 20240107121006.png]]
- To create a new directory use the `mkdir` command.
- If we add a `-p` parameter we can create sets of directories and their subdirectories in one command.
- ![[Pasted image 20240107121033.png]]
- The `rmdir` is for the removing of directory where we can remove only the empty one.
- But when we use the `rm -r` we can delete a directory full of data.
## Files:
- To view a file type use the `file` command. `cat` Command is used to view the whole file in a shell.
- The `-n` is for the numbering the line. The `-b` is for numbering only the text lines. The `-T` is for the removing tab spaces.
- The cat cannot control the things so we can use the more or less commands. The less is an advanced version of the more. To view the part of files we can use the tail or head commands. We can use the `-n` for the number of lines to mention.
