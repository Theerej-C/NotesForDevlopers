- The modules are the building block of the code sharing in the terraform where the code re usability comes to play.
- With Terraform, you can put your code inside of a Terraform module and reuse that module in multiple places throughout your code.
- ![[Pasted image 20240321222814.png]]
- A Terraform module is very simple: any set of Terraform configuration files in a folder is a module. if you run apply directly on a module, it’s referred to as a root module.
- We can use a module in any area where the syntax is the:
```
module "<NAME>" {
source = "<SOURCE>"
[CONFIG ...]
}
// Eg:
module "webserver_cluster" {
source = "../../../modules/services/webserver-cluster"
}
```
* Note that whenever you add a module to your Terraform configurations or modify the source parameter of a module, you need to run the init command before you run plan or apply.
* We had the hard coded name in the files so we need to have the inputs in the modules.
## Inputs and Outputs:
- Terraform, modules can have input parameters, too. To define them, you use a mechanism : input variables.
- We should set the variable name in the modules using the same variables.tf file in the modules and then we need to mention this in the main.tf of the modules:
```
variable "cluster_name" {
description = "The name to use for all the cluster resources"
type = string
}
```
- Then in the place where we use this module use this variable as the input like:
```
module "webserver_cluster" {
source = "../../../modules/services/webserver-cluster"
cluster_name = "webservers-stage"
db_remote_state_bucket = "(YOUR_BUCKET_NAME)"
db_remote_state_key = "stage/data-stores/mysql/terraform.tfstate"
}
```
* The input variables are the API of the module, controlling how it will behave in different environments.
* When we need to set some input variables in the module but it need to be locally that means no other thing can modify it we use the module locals:
```
locals {
http_port = 80
any_port = 0
any_protocol = "-1"
tcp_protocol = "tcp"
all_ips = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}
```
- To read the value of a local, you need to use a local reference, which uses the following syntax: `local.<NAME>`.
- In Terraform, a module can also return values. Again, you do this using a mechanism you already know: output variables. You can access module output variables using the following syntax: `module.<MODULE_NAME>.<OUTPUT_NAME>`.
```
output "asg_name" {
value = aws_autoscaling_group.example.name
description = "The name of the Auto Scaling Group"
}
// Usage in other file
output "alb_dns_name" {
value = module.webserver_cluster.alb_dns_name
description = "The domain name of the load balancer"
}
```
## Gotchas:
- When creating modules, watch out for these gotchas:
	- File paths
	- Inline blocks
### File Paths:
- By default, Terraform interprets the path relative to the current working directory.
- We can use expression known as a path reference, which is of the form `path.<TYPE>` for having the file system path of the module where the expression is defined(Expression in the module folder).
	-  `path.root` - Returns the filesystem path of the root module.
	- `path.module` - Returns the filesystem path of the module where the expression is defined.
	- `path.cwd` - Returns the filesystem path of the current working directory.
- Example of the usage of the file paths is:
```
user_data = templatefile("${path.module}/user-data.sh", {
server_port = var.server_port
db_address = data.terraform_remote_state.db.outputs.address
db_port = data.terraform_remote_state.db.outputs.port
})
```
### Inline blocks:
- An inline block is an argument you set within a resource of the format: 
```
resource "xxx" "yyy" {
	<NAME> {
	[CONFIG...]
	}
}
```
- A separate resource block is much more flexible than the inline blocks so prefer that. The advantage of using separate resources is that they can be added anywhere, whereas an inline block can only be added within the module that creates a resource.
- For Example To make your module more flexible, you should change it to define the exact same ingress and egress rules by using separate aws_security_group_rule resources.
## Versioning:
- For example we have a staging and a production environment which refers to same module so when there is a change in the staging part and the module changes the production also changes. Which will create some problems as the production is important.
- A better approach is to create versioned modules so that you can use one version in staging (e.g., v0.0.2) and a different version in production (e.g., v0.0.1).
- The easiest way to create a versioned module is to put the code for the module in a separate Git repository and to set the source parameter to that repository’s URL.
- We use the git syntax of tagging like `git tag -a "v0.0.1" -m "First release of webserver-cluster module"` which will tag the version in it.
- Then we can use this versioned module in the module of the tf file using the git hub repository link:
```
module "webserver_cluster" {
source = "github.com/foo/modules//services/webserver-cluster?ref=v0.0.1"
cluster_name = "webservers-stage"
db_remote_state_bucket = "(YOUR_BUCKET_NAME)"
db_remote_state_key = "stage/data-stores/mysql/terraform.tfstate"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
min_size = 2
max_size = 2
}
```
- After this modification we need to run the `terraform init` to download the module from the remote repository.
