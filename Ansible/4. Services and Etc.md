- The services like the Apache server are not automatically started in the Cent OS like OS so we need to manipulate the server so that it starts the server.
- So we can use the `service` module in the ansible to do so so that the service will be manipulated.
```
tasks:
    - name: install mariadb server on CentOS
      tags: db,mariadb,centos
      yum:
        name: mariadb-server
        state: latest
      when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS"  
    - name: Start mariadb service on centos
      tags: db,mariadb,centos
      service:
        name: mariadb
        state: started 
      when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS"
```
- So here we had installed the `mariadb` and started the server for it we can also can do it for the httpd, etc. Then if we want to enable the service so that it will start automatically during the startup then just add the `enables: yes` below the `state`.
