- Business starts when we have a feel when there is a urge for a change.
- The first thing to consider is that when you are good at something do it if you are not at something just outsource it.
- The second thing is the idea where the idea don't need to be original we can have something someone has other so we can combine everything.
- Then the next one is the execution which is the first step to execute your idea. It can be anything like podcast, videos, etc.
- Next think about the revenue side think where are the revenue is going to come. For example if I am an software based company think how to get the money or the revenue side.
- Next step is the purpose. Think about the purpose of the thing you do. Don't be money minded just find the purpose what are going to give to other how to convince others that the thing you do has a purpose.
- And the next main step is that don't look for investors money or anything first start without money like services. Then we can expand it so that we can make money.
## Winning:
- The delay gratification is the first point. We need to have a delayed gratification and wait man. Like spend the initial time for customer satisfaction, grab more clients, etc. 
- The client centric business is the point to success. We need to incorporate the culture around the company where it is customer centric. This ensures the long term goals of the company.
- The next point is the luck. Luck is not the automatic there are some cheats. The first one is persistence and hook to it. The next force is define what is success for you that means look for the goal. The next point is to take risk not all the workers are gaining everything.
- When we work hard we get luck is the biggest lie. That means in the process of the business growth hard work is different. But the risk is the thing which will give us advantage.
- We need to have a mindset that everything is lost there is no problem I am persistent and the loss doesn't matter to me. Accept every loss and learn from it.
- Wait wait wait first build a brand then make money. Don't rush everything just wait.
## Lose:
- The thing to note is that success is not always the success. The key to success is the accepting the failure.
- Don't let things own you is the main principle. We need to mark which are the things which is the liability and get rid of it.
- Let the short term ego go. This doesn't mean the ego for business is lost. This means don't allow short term ego to be going on. Like buying an car so that other thing you are successful is the worst thing. Just let others think you are losing.
- Just accept the losing. Getting a D in a business is take your time don't always want a A. Internalize the ego just don't allow others decide what you do. They can judge no issue just don't what you do.
## Mind Map:
- First stop the business plan because to traditional approach can kill the business. Just do a mind map which can be expanded.
- The base core layer is the hobby what you love to do. Then the next outer layer is the business. From the business we can mark the points like what we had done and what are responses. Like when we start a you tube channel then the addons are the network we grow, the reach we got, etc. This include the application building, marketing, etc.

## Purpose:
- When we don't have a purpose we will work for others purposes. So the main point is the purpose which we need to concentrate. 
- The concept of group comes when there is a common purpose for the whole culture inside the company. There should be give without take mentality among the culture inside the company.
- Then think about what problem are you going to solve. What is the important problem you are going to solve in the future with your business.
- Then matching the purpose with what we do daily. Like we need to match every moves we make to match the purpose of ours.
- And also don't think in selfish just look for other like minded guys.
## Cofounder:
- The starting point is that what you love to do and what you hate to do. We need to take the part of what we love to do.
- And we need to look to a person who has the passion of what you hate to do. But remember about the equity. 
- And also look for the person who has the same moral values as you which is the most important thing. Know everything about that person so that you can predict everything and also just choose a guy who will respect you give you space, etc. 
- Just look for the person who wants the work more not the money which means morally correct individuals.
- Then post it. Just ask people what you are looking for. Just post it anywhere or just talk with people so that you can find a person.

## Selling:
- Sell the sizzle not the steak. Which means don't sell the product as a product just sell it in a manner how it solves the problem. The smell of the steak is the selling point where the explanation of the taste of steak is waste of time. 
- Just pick the people who are the potential one which increase our business like apple would chose just 3500 people who are the important one who talks about the product.
- Then understand the customer where the customer management is the key part.
