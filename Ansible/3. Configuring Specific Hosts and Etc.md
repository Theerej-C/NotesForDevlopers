- So when there are different types of servers like DB server, Web server, Etc then we need to configure them differently for different use case. So we are going to use the grouping mechanism in the inventory file like:
```
[web_servers]
ubu@192.168.56.106 apache_package=apache2 php_package=libapache2-mod-php
```
