- We can create a ansible.cfg in the same directory for the configuration. So this configuration file will hold all the information like default inventory file, default key file, etc which will shorten the command and structure is like 
```
[defaults]
inventory = inventory
private_key_file = ~/.ssh/ansible
```
- Then the command is just `ansible all -m ping`. The `ansible all --list-hosts` will list all the host in the ansible systems in the inventory. The `ansible all -m gather_facts` which is a module which is the all the information of the server which is running like OS, environment variables, etc.
- Then we use the flag `--limit IP` for the specific server name in the inventory. 
### Commands With Elevated privileges:
- The commands which modify the system of the server or any other modification is the privilege commands which will not run in normal time like `ansible all -m apt -a update_cache=true` which is an update module with the argument of update but this will fail.
- So we need to use the sudo like thing in the ansible to run the privilege commands which is the two flags `--become --ask-become-pass`. Which will update the system when there is a internet connection to it.
- The `--become` will tell the system as the sudo user then the next one is for the password asking. For this apt module we has many options like installing the packages and upgrading.
- To use multiple arguments then we need the quotes like `"update_cache=true SECOND_ARGUMENT"`. 
### Playbooks:
- These are files which are used in the ansible to automate the tasks with the `.yml` extension(yaml file). The plays are the commands which ansible will use to bring the server to the required state.
- The commands will be starting with the `- ` and a space like `- hosts: all`. 
```
---

- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:

  - name: install apache2 package
    apt: 
      name: apache2
```
- So this would be the syntax which is just the yaml syntax and the sentences are simple. Here the sudo privilege is asked using the `become` then a task of name `install apache2 package` is run with the command of `apt` with name of `apache2`.
- So to run the playbook use the command `ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass install_apache.yml` which will run the playbook and then the `ask-become-pass` is for password asking.

```
---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: update repo index
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
    - name: install apache2 package
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: latest

    - name: add php support 
      apt:
        name: libapache2-mod-php
        state: latest
```
- This is an another example where we do three tasks and also set the state to latest so that every time we run the playbook then the upgrade is done. When we set the same state to `absent` then the packages will be removed.
### When Conditional:
- When we have different types of the OS so that we need to run different commands so there is thing called when condition.
- So we can use the when statement after a command so that when the condition in it pass then only the command will run otherwise not.
- For example 
```
tasks:
    - name: update repo index
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
      when: ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"
```
- Here it checks for the OS type and wants the Ubuntu type. So when we want to run the command for different types of OS here is the syntax `when: ansible_distribution in ["Ubuntu", "Debian"]`.
- We can use the `and` and `or` statements in the when statement so that we can set conditions instead of the condition. Like `when ansible_distribution == "CentOS" and ansible_distribution_version == "8.2"`.
- This is the final for the Cent OS which is different than the Ubuntu or the Debian.
```
---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: update repo index centos
      dnf:
        update_cache: yes
      when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS"

    - name: install apache2 package centos
      dnf:
        name: httpd
        state: latest
      when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS"    
    - name: add php support centos
      dnf:
        name: php
        state: latest
      when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS"
```
### Efficient Playbook:
- When we want to install multiple packages for the same OS and the same Package manager then we can list the Packages we want instead of different tasks for each one.
```
 - name: install apache2 package centos
      dnf:
        name: 
          - httpd
          - php
        state: latest
      when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS"    
```
- And also the modules of the modules for example `update_cache` module of the `apt` module can be written in the single play like 
```
 - name: install apache2 and php package
      apt:
        name: 
          - apache2
          - libapache2-mod-php
        state: latest
        update_cache: yes
      when: ansible_distribution in ["Ubuntu", "Debian"]
```
- So we can get rid of the 2 playbooks to one which can done using the variables where we mention only the variable name and then using it in the play like:
```
---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: install apache and php package
      package:
        name: 
          - "{{ apache_package }}"
          - "{{ php_package }}"
        state: latest
        update_cache: yes
```
- So here the variable name is there `apache_package` and `php_package` we mention these two things in the inventory file like
```
ubu@192.168.56.106 apache_package=apache2 php_package=libapache2-mod-php

```
- Similarly the `package` word instead of the `apt` is to set the package manager of the OS automatically.
