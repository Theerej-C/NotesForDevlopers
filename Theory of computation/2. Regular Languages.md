- As we look into computers are complex machines we cannot directly derive some mathematical proof on it so we use the [[computational model]]
- So first we can look into simple model which is `finite state machine` or `finite automation`
- A computer with a very limited amount of memory like automatic door opening system is an example of finite automata.
- The finite automata and their probabilistic counter part [[Markov chains]] are useful tools when we are attempting to recognize patterns in data.
- The automaton is a singular form of automata which describes a machine which can simulate job done by a human and more.

- Here q2 is the desired state so which ever input attain it is accepted.
- A finite automaton has many parts like like set of states and rules to move from one state to another according to the input symbol. We use the transition function which is denoted by δ to define the rules of moving.
- The formal definition for the finite automaton is:
	- A finite automaton is a 5-tuple (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F), where
		1. Q is a finite set called the states,
		2. Σ is a finite set called the alphabet,
		3. δ: Q × Σ−→Q is the transition function,1
		4. q0 ∈ Q is the start state, and
		5. F ⊆ Q is the set of accept states.2
- If A is set of all strings this machine accept then the A is called the language of the machine M and write *L(M) = A*. The machine can accept several strings but it can accept only one language. It can also accept empty language like ∅.
- Example of language is like for previous example A = { w | w contains at least one 1 and an even number of 0 follow the last 1 }. This defines the language of strings accepted by M1 because these strings which are part of language are the one which are accepted.
- $\begin{aligned}&\mathbf{Q}|\Psi_{1}\rangle = (1-2a)|\Psi_{1}\rangle - 2a|\Psi_{0}\rangle\\&\mathbf{Q}|\Psi_{0}\rangle = 2(1-a)|\Psi_{1}\rangle+(1-2a)|\Psi_{0}\rangle,\end{aligned}$
