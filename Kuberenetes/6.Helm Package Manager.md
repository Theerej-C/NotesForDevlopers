* Helm is an package manager for the kubernetes where we can maintain the packages in kubernetes cluster.
* It helps to reduce many manual jobs like searching for the components in the internet for a single service.
* For example if we use a elastic search for logging then we need some stateful set for DB, services, config maps, etc for it. Searching for separate components is tedious. So using the helm we can do this easily.
