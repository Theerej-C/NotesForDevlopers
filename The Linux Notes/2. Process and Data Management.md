- The `ps` command is an important one to know which will help in monitoring the processes. There are three types of the extensions are there for `ps` command. I will use the BSD style(Berkley).
- `T` for all process of terminal. The `a` for all process. The `l` for the long format. The `r` for the running process only. The `S` which sums the data of child process to parent one.
- The `m` is for threads. The `w` for the wide output. The `f` for the hierarchal output. The `e` for the environment variables of the process.
- The `x` is an important one which shows each and every process To see the process in real time use the top command.
- The load average in the 1st line of the top is load of system where 1st one is 1 minute load which is short burst of processes. But the 15 min load is dangerous. The `f` is to select the fields in the top.
- The kill command is for the process killing. And there are many process signals to know.
- The default kill will send the TERM signal(15) which terminates if possible.
- The kill can be used on process id only.
- The -s parameter is used to use other signals. The main one is KILL or 9 which is unconditional termination.
- The killall is an powerful tool which can be used to kill all the process using special characters.
## Disk Management:
- The Linux takes all the media disks as virtual directories. So we should mount the storages we add as a vir dirs.
- The empty mount command will give 4 info The name of the file, The mount location, The type of file system, The permissions.
- The mount command is used to mount the filesystem. The syntax is *mount -t filesystemtype device directory*
- Most usb memory sticks are vfat file systems.
- The options are many but the important ones are -r, -w, -n (unregistered mount).
- Use the man tab for the mount for all details.
- The umount is for unmounting the device where we can use the device name or the directory name.
- The df command is used for the disk management. The -h is for human readable format.
- The du is for the disk usage of specific directories. The -c is for sum total in that dirs.

Data Files:

- The sort command is for the sorting data in the text files. The sort command interrupts numbers as chars. So use the -n param for the numerical one.
- ![[Pasted image 20240107121937.png|400]]
- The -M is for month sort which identifies the three letter months in files to sort in monthly order.
- The -c is for the checking the sorting.
- The -t is for seperator mention and -k is for positional argument.
- The -r is for the descending order.
- The grep command is for finding a specific text in the text fields.
- We can use all kinds of regular expressions to do the grep functions.
- The zipping utilities are several in linux.
- The gzip and the bzip are the important one(.bz2, .gz) where the compression has the .z extension.
- gzip for compressing files. gzcat for displaying the contents of compressed text files. gunzip for uncompressing files
- The compression can be done to the individual files so if we want to compress folders we need to archive those folders into single file.
- The tar is the famous utility for the archiving. It uses the functions and the options. The -c is for create tar and -x is for extract tar. The -t is for only listing the content of the tar.
- Then the f option for the file output. The v option for verbose. Then the p is for file permission preserving.
- Then we can use the unzip or bunzip to unzip the files.
