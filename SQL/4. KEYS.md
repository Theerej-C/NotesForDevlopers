- The primary key is the unique and not null identifier of a table in mysql where we can refer it to refer the row from the table and it will be unique.
- For example if we are a citizen in a nation then there is a possibility of similar names so we need to have a number to mention the person which should be unique.
- We set a column of a table to `primary key` when creation using the constriants.
