- We can create a ansible.cfg in the same directory for the configuration. So this configuration file will hold all the information like default inventory file, default key file, etc which will shorten the command and structure is like 
```
[defaults]
inventory = inventory
private_key_file = ~/.ssh/ansible
```
- Then the command is just `ansible all -m ping`. The `ansible all --list-hosts` will list all the host in the ansible systems in the inventory. The `ansible all -m gather_facts` which is a module which is the all the information of the server which is running like OS, environment variables, etc.
- Then we use the flag `--limit IP` for the specific server name in the inventory. 
### Commands With Elevated privileges:
- The commands which modify the system of the server or any other modification is the privilege commands which will not run in normal time like `ansible all -m apt -a update_cache=true` which is an update module with the argument of update but this will fail.
- So we need to use the sudo like thing in the ansible to run the privilege commands which is the two flags `--become --ask-become-pass`. Which will update the system when there is a internet connection to it.
- The `--become` will tell the system as the sudo user then the next one is for the password asking. For this apt module we has many options like installing the packages and upgrading.
- To use multiple arguments then we need the quotes like `"update_cache=true SECOND_ARGUMENT"`. 
### Playbooks:
- These are files which are used in the ansible to automate the tasks with the `.yml` extension(yaml file). The plays are the commands which ansible will use to bring the server to the required state.
- The commands will be starting with the `- ` and a space like `- hosts: all`. 
```
---

- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:

  - name: install apache2 package
    apt: 
      name: apache2
```
- So this would be the syntax which is just the yaml syntax and the sentences are simple. Here the sudo privilege is asked using the `become` then a task of name `install apache2 package` is run with the command of `apt` with name of `apache2`.
- So to run the playbook use the command `ansible-playbook --ask-become-pass install_apache.yml` which will run the playbook and then the `ask-become-pass` is for password asking.

- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: update repo index
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
    - name: install apache2 package
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: latest

    - name: add php support 
      apt:
        name: libapache2-mod-php
        state: latest
```
- This is an another example where we do three tasks and also set the state to latest so that every time we run the playbook then the upgrade is done. When we set the same state to `absent` then the packages will be removed.
