- The main purpose of the ansible is to provision servers where the scale of the servers can be any big. This automates as many servers as we want. The ansible control host which will the control of the server. The connection is the SSH mode from the controller to the server.
- The ansible control host can be anything like the laptop or anything. So maximum we need to have the code in the git for collaboration.
- Open SSH is the tool which is used in the ansible to connect to others where the key management is an important one.
## Ubuntu Server in VBox:
- As we use the Ubuntu server in the virtual box there will be a problem in the IP so we need to use the 2 adaptor method where the `NAT` is for the internet connectivity and the `Host only` is for the communication between `VM's` .
- So when we first set this it won't work so we need to change the net plan settings using the `nano /etc/netplan/FileName` where we need to add an another adopter with the adopter name and set the `dhcp4` to true. 
- Then restart the server then there will be the IP.
## OPEN SSH:
- There are two types of authentication in the SSH the password based, Key based where the key based will automatically logs you in but the password requires pass. Then the key based is the more secure than the password based.
- The first point is that open SSH should be installed in the workstations and the servers. The open SSH is the way which the ansible is installed.
- Then we should connect the servers from the machine where we give the yes to the prompt which is only one time. We can create the SSH key pair for the normal user. Then we can use a new SSH ansible keys also.
- The key management is the main thing in the ssh where the command is `ssh-keygen` where this will create a default key we can add many options to it.
- Like the `-t` for the type and so on like `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "theerej"`. Then there will be some questions like which directory, etc.
- The default location for the key is the .ssh folder in the home directory. There are two files the normal private key and the `.pub` which is the public key.
- So this public key which is the one which we send to anyone in the world where we need to share the information. The copy of the ssh public key to another server is very simple and using the SSH itself using the command `ssh-copy-id -i LOCATION_OF_PUBLIC_KEY IP_ADDRESS_OF_SERVER`.
- So when we added the key to the server then when we try to login to the server using the SSH then the password is not asked the pass phrase is asked in that.
- So for the ansible we create a separate key for it. So when there is a prompt for the location we use the separate file name for this key. We should not use the passphrase so that ansible handle it.
- So we can use the `-i` flag to set which key we want to use to login like `ssh -i .ssh/ansible ubu@192.168.56.104`. We can save the passphrase in the cache in the current terminal using the `eval $(ssh-agent)` which starts a agent then `ssh-add` then type the passphrase.
## Installation and Ad hoc commands:
- To install ansible there are many ways like repository and the simple apt command and also the pip version.
- Then after installation there is a requirement of the inventory file which contains the IP address of all the hosts. We can use the `ansible` command to do the job for us.
- For first thing we need to check the connection of the application we use the ping module of it like `ansible all --key-file ~/.ssh/ansible -i inventory -m ping`. Which will try to connect to the IP address in the inventory list.

- In this command we use the ansible key and the inventory file for the host. But running always some commands won't automate things so we need to write some configuration like [[2.Configurations and Playbooks]].
