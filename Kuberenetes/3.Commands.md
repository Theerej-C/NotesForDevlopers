* The first command for the kubernetes is the finding the status of the pods is `kubectl get nodes`
* The next one is the status of the services like DB `kubectl get services`.
* The `kubectl create` is used to create various components in the kubernetes cluster. Usually we wont create a kubernetes pod we create a deployment. 
* So the syntax is the `kubectl create deployment NAME --image=image`

* The command `kubectl get` command is very vast as there are many options like seeing the replica set, etc.
* The abstractions works like the deployment manages the replica set, The replica set manages the pods, The pods are the abstractions of the container.
* We can edit the deployment and  any thing using the `kubectl edit NAME`. It will produce the default configuration file with the default values. 
* ![[Pasted image 20240228214601.png]]
* We can use the `kubectl describe pod(or anything) nameOfThePod` to describe the pod.
* Then the `kubectl logs podname` will tell the logs of the pods in the real time. The point to be noted is that we need to specify the full pod name from the get command.
* ![[Pasted image 20240228215756.png]]
* We can use the `kubectl exec` command to login to the pod as the shell we wanted. Like ![[Pasted image 20240228220043.png]]
* The -it for the interactive and the bin/bash can also be mentioned using the empty flag.
* An another important command is the apply command which has the syntax  of the `kubectl apply -f [file name]` which will take the configuration file and the do as we intended to be using a config file.
* ![[Pasted image 20240228221300.png]]
* The deployment file will have a certain syntax as a yml file. We need to be careful and for example:
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.16
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080

```
