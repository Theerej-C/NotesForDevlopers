- We can create a ansible.cfg in the same directory for the configuration. So this configuration file will hold all the information like default inventory file, default key file, etc which will shorten the command and structure is like 
```
[defaults]
inventory = inventory
private_key_file = ~/.ssh/ansible
```
- Then the command is just `ansible all -m ping`. The `ansible all --list-hosts` will list all the host in the ansible systems in the inventory. The `ansible all -m gather_facts` which is a module which is the all the information of the server which is running like OS, environment variables, etc.
- Then we use the flag `--limit IP` for the specific server name in the inventory.
