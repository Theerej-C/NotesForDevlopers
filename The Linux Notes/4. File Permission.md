- The main linux user protection is the user accounts. Each user account has a different UID.
- The etc/passwd is a special file which links the UID and details of the users like user name, shell, etc.
- The olden day linux has a policy of running every background and foreground process in root permissions. Which is a security issue.
- But now all the process(System Processes) will have separate user accounts which has UID below 500.
- The password section in the passwd file is just dummy and the original encrypted passwords are in the /etc/shadow file which can be only accessed by the special process like login.
- The main tool to add a user is useradd. The /etc/default/useradd file has the default user adding params like group id etc. We can modify it to have a custom default values.
- The /etc/skel is the template of the default useradd home folder.
- -m is for the user home directory creation.
- The -p option is difficult to add password for the user because we need to enter the password in encrypted form. So use the passwd username to set the password.
- There are many params in the useradd we can use it to change the default values.
- The userdel is used to delete a user from the system.
- When we use the -r param we can remove the home and mail directory of that user
- For modifying users we use different utilities like:

- usermod Edits user account fields, as well as specifying primary and secondary group membership
- passwd Changes the password for an existing user
- chpasswd Reads a file of login name and password pairs, and updates the passwords
- chage Changes the password’s expiration date
- chfn Changes the user account’s comment information
- chsh Changes the user account’s default shell

- In usermod the main command in the -l which can be used to rename the user name
- The chpasswd command is very useful in changing passwd for many users. Mention a text file with usrname:password  format with all names and passwords.

Groups:

- Like /etc/passwd there is the /etc/group file where the group info is stored.
- Groupadd command will create a new group. When we create a group there will be no users. We should use the usermod command with -G param to add that user to the group
- Should not use the -g parameter because it will erase all the group entries which user have and replace it with new group. Use the -G only.
- We can use the groupmod command to change the group id by -g and group name by -n.

- File permissions:

- The ls -l command will show the file details where the first column is about the type of file and the permissions among the user groups.
- The first character will represent the type of file:

- - for files
-  d for directories
-  l for links
-  c for character devices
-  b for block devices
-  n for network devices

- Then the three characters triplets will represent the file permissions for set of users. The r-read w-write x-execute.
- The three sets define

- Owner of the file
- The group that own the object
- Everyone else.

- The default file permission which is assigned to the file when created can be know by the umask command.
- The octal system is followed in the file permissions. For example as there are 3 characters rwe it is converted to 8 bit octets.
- For example the bit value is 4 so the binary is 100 so the permission is r--
- So the bit value of three groups is arranged for example 777 which means all permission for all
- So the function of the umask is :

- The file will be created with the permission of 666 which is r and w by all users. Now it will reduce 22 from it.
- Like 666-22 = 644 as the file permission.

- We can change the umask value by umask value
- The default permission for a directory is 777 so umask is subtracted from that.
- The chmod is an utility which can be used to change the file permission or security setting of files and directories.
- The syntax is chmod octal filename/dirname
- The other syntax is that chmod [ugoa..] [+-=] [ rwxXstugo..]

- • The u for user permission, g for group, o for others, a for all users.
	• The last set of characters are for 
		• X assigns execute permissions only if the object is a directory or if it already had
		execute permissions.
		• s sets the UID or GID on execution.
		• t saves program text.
		• u sets the permissions to the owner’s permissions.
		• g sets the permissions to the group’s permissions.
		• o sets the permissions to the other’s permissions.
	• The chown command is for changing the owner of the file.
	• Then chgrp command is for changing the group ownership of the file
	• We can use the chown to change the default group of a file by .groupname filename syntax.
	• The sgid and the suid is for the sharing files among the users. Most importantly setting the sgid or shared group id for an directory is very helpful which sets the default group id of the directory to the files created in that directory.
	• These values can be set using adding a 4th digit to the beginning of the 3 digit file permission.
	• The last bit is sticky bit which is used to set the file to be stay in memory after process is complete. 
	• The 001 represents the sticky bit set and 1st bit for suid and 2nd bit for sgid.
	• To share a directory create the directory and set a default user and then set the gid using the g+s option in the chmod.
