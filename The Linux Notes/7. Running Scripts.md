- Linux uses signals to communicate with processes running on the system. There are more than 30 signals which linux uses to communicate with the process.
- ![[Pasted image 20240331220532.png]]
- - By default bash shell ignores the 3, 15 but will stops during the 1 signal. And also it passes the SIGHUP to all the child processes.
- We can set the shell scripts to recognize the shell commands and the Signals.
- By default CTRL-C will send a SIGINT to interrupt the process and stops it.
- But the CTRL-Z is for the SIGTSTP which stops the process but it leaves the process in the memory.
- We can see the stopped jobs in the PS command.

# Trapping:

- The trapping of the signals can be done and we can redirect that to other things.
- The trap command used for this. Syntax trap commands signals.
- Besides the signals we can also trap the ending, etc of the process using the trap.
- We can easily modify the traps in the middle of the scripts using the same trap command.
- And if we want to entrap the trap then we use the -- before the trap signal and trap command.

# Nohup:

- The process can be run without being hungup after the terminal is also closed.
- The nohup command will bind the command to the direct system not in terminal process.
- The nohup will store the result of the process in the nohup.out file.
- We can view all the jobs using the jobs command. The -l param can be used to list all the process ID also.

# Restarting:

- When we paused a job using the CTRL-Z we can restart using two commands like bg, fg.
- The bg will be used to start the stopped process in the background mode. Then the fg is used to start the process in the foreground mode.
- The bg numberofprocess can be used to start the specific process which is stopped.

- In multitasking CPU the process can have different priorities according to the process. The priority can be represented in a integer. This is the scheduler priority which is the CPU time assigned by the kernel.
- The integer can be from -20 which is highest priority. Where +19 is the least priority.
- The nice is an command is used to turn the process priority to the desired value.
- The -n flag is for adding the priority to the process with the integer next to the -n flag.
- We can set the priority of an job to an lower one but if we tried to set the priority to higher nice will prevent an normal user to do it.
- The renice command is used to re do the priority of the running process in the system using the -p flag with process ID.
- The rules are:

- You can only renice processes that you own. You can only renice your processes to a lower priority. The root user can renice any process to any priority

# Job Scheduling at specific time:

- The at command is used to specify a time when a specific script should run.
- A standard at command is like at -f filename time. The time param is used to specify the time where the time format can be many things. The am, pm indicators, names time like now, midnight, etc , etc.
- The at will submit the job in the job queue which has 26 queues where higher alphabets are lower priority. The default one is the a.
- The default out of the at is sent to the user as an mail. But this is inconvinient so we can suppress that by the -M flag.
- The atq is the command to find the jobs queue. We can remove the job using the atrm command with the job number from atq

- - The at has the ability to run a script at a specific time only. But if we need to run every day we need to use the cron.
- The cron tab has a specific format to mention in the cron table for the jobs to be done.
- - We should build the cron table for the perfect function which can be done using the crontab -e function.
- There are templates for the crontab jobs in the /etc/cron.*ly files. If we copy the script to these directories we can do the jobs accordingly.
- But the problem with the cron is that it thinks that the system will run for 24*7. The jobs during the system off is not completed.
- So the anacron is the one which does the job which will do the job when the system boots up again.
* The functions are marked by the function keyword or the func() format.
- The notes for the function would be in code format so the comments will be the notes.
```
#!/bin/bash
function func1 {
  echo "Hello"
}
```
