- The primary key is the unique and not null identifier of a table in mysql where we can refer it to refer the row from the table and it will be unique.
- For example if we are a citizen in a nation then there is a possibility of similar names so we need to have a number to mention the person which should be unique.
- We set a column of a table to `primary key` when creation using the constraints.
```
create table names
(
	name INT primary key,
	name1 VARCHAR(30),
	price DECIMAL,
);
```
- And to alter an existing table column to primary key we use the alter command like
```
alter table products 
add constraint 
primary key(product_id);
```
### AUTO INCREMENT:
- Auto increment is an feature in the mysql where if we set a value to be auto incremented then the value will be incremented as we insert a row into the table.
- We set the auto increment in the same way as the primary key like in the creation of the table and we can set other than 1 as the default value.
```
create table hello(
	hello1 int auto_increment,
	hello2 int,
	...
)
// Altering 
alter table hello 
auto_increment = 1000;
```
### FOREIGN KEY:
- A foreign key is like primary key but we can have multiple one in the table and it will refer some other primary key from another table creating a relationship.
- ![[Pasted image 20240331171024.png]]
- To set a table column to foreign key we can do it in creation of table or after creation:
```
create table transactions (
	transaction_id int primary key,
    transaction_name varchar(50),
    customer_id int,
    foreign key(customer_id) references customer(customer_id)
);  
```
- As we had the foreign key if we want to delete the foreign key constraint we need to see the name of it in the left panel of the sql editor or we should name it.
```
alter table transactions
drop foreign key transactions_ibfk_1;
```
- As we see the name is weird so we can add the name of the foreign key using the same alter command and add constraint.
```
alter table transactions
add constraint trans_const
foreign key(customer_id) references customer(customer_id);
```
