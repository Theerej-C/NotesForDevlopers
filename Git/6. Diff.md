* `git diff`: Displays the changes made between the current version and the previous version. 
* `git diff --cached`: Displays the changes made between the current version and the version stored in the cache.( staged changes )
* `git diff --staged`: Displays the changes made between the current version and the version that is staged for the next commit. 
* `git diff --interactive`: Allows you to interactively select which changes to include in your next commit.
* The git diff main purpose is to see the changes in the files in the current repo. It checks for the staged one and indexed one.

 `git diff`
git diff shows the difference between your working directory and the index. 
`git diff commit`
This form summarizes the differences between your working directory and the
given commit. 
`git diff - -cached commit`
This command shows the differences between the staged changes in the index and
the given commit. 
If the option --cached doesnâ€™t make sense to you, perhaps the synonym --staged
will. It is available in Git version 1.6.1 and later.
`git diff commit1 commit2`
If you specify two arbitrary commits, the command displays the differences between the two. 
* There are git diff ranges like the git log. But the operation of the git diff is completely different.
* The git diff completely checks all the files from the one commit till all the commits between the range of the commits and tell the difference.
