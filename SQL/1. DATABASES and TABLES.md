* The SQL is the Structured Query Language which is a relational database model where we use the language SQL to manipulate the data.
* The relational database where the data is related using the keys.
* The DBMS are the system which facilitates to use the SQL and database where the MySQL is the good one.
* We create a table using the `create database TABLENAME` where the keyword there is no case sensitivity.
* We use the `use NAMEOFDB` to use the DB and use the `drop DBNAME` to drop the database.
* We can change the DB to be read only using the `alter database mydb read only = 1;`. To disable it use the same command with 0.
## Tables:
* A table is like a file in a folder(DB). The syntax for the creation of the table is the :
```
CREATE TABLE TABLE_NAME(
	COLUMNNAME DATATYPE,
	...,
	...,
);
```
* If we want to select all the column in the table we can use the query `select * from employee_table;`. Then we can rename the table by the syntax `rename table employee_table to workers_table;`
* Similarly as the droping the DB the syntax is same for the table `drop table TABLENAME`.
* The altering of table is also easy using the keyword `alter` and for adding a new column:
```
alter table employee_table 
add phone_number varchar(15);
```
* The syntax for the renaming the columns we use the same alter with the rename and modify is to modify the column behaviour like data type:
```
alter table employee_table 
rename column phone_number to email;

alter table employee_table 
modify column email varchar(100);
```
* We can use the same `modify` in the `alter` to bring the order of the columns in the table by moving the columns with the before and after:
```
alter table employee_table 
modify email varchar(100)
after employee_last_name; // FIRST for the first column
```
* We use the same `alter` for dropping the columns also like `alter table employee_table drop column email;`.
