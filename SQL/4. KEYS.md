- The primary key is the unique and not null identifier of a table in mysql where we can refer it to refer the row from the table and it will be unique.
- For example if we are a citizen in a nation then there is a possibility of similar names so we need to have a number to mention the person which should be unique.
- We set a column of a table to `primary key` when creation using the constraints.
```
create table names
(
	name INT primary key,
	name1 VARCHAR(30),
	price DECIMAL,
);
```
- And to alter an existing table column to primary key we use the alter command like
```
alter table products 
add constraint 
primary key(product_id);
```
### AUTO INCREMENT:
- Auto increment is an feature in the mysql where if we set a value to be auto incremented then the value will be incremented as we insert a row into the table.
- We set the auto increment in the same way as the primary key like in the creation of the table and we can set other than 1 as the default value.
```
create table hello(
	hello1 int auto_increment,
	hello2 int,
	...
)
// Altering 
alter table hello 
auto_increment = 1000;
```
### FOREIGN KEY:
- A foreign key is like primary key but we can have multiple one in the table and it will refer some other primary key from another table creating a relationship.

- To set a table column to foreign key we can do it in creation of table or after creation:
