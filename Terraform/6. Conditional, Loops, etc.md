- Terraform offers several different looping constructs, each intended to be used in a slightly different scenario:
	- `count` parameter, to loop over resources and modules
	- `for_each` expressions, to loop over resources, inline blocks within a resource, and modules
	- `for` expressions, to loop over lists and maps
	- `for` string directive, to loop over lists and maps within a string
- Every Terraform resource has a meta-parameter you can use called count. count is Terraformâ€™s oldest, simplest, and most limited iteration construct: all it does is define how many copies of the resource to create.
```
resource "aws_iam_user" "example" {
count = 3
name = "neo.${count.index}"
}
```
- Like other programming languages we can get the elements of an array in the tf file like: `ARRAY[<INDEX>]`
- First we need to create the array using the variable then we can iterate through it:
```
variable "user_names" {
description = "Create IAM users with these names"
type = list(string)
default = ["neo", "trinity", "morpheus"]
}
// Usage:
resource "aws_iam_user" "example" {
count = length(var.user_names)
name = var.user_names[count.index]
}
```
