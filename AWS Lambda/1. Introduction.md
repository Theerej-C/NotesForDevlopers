* It is a structure where it run functions on demand without the server. Where it supports many languages.
* We can use the lambda for Ad hoc tasks or completely server less high TPS applications.
* The lambda is very cost efficient as we pay per usage.
* It comes with the build in metrics with AWS cloud watch(Cloud Watch enables you to monitor your complete stack (applications, infrastructure, network, and services) and use alarms, logs, and events data to take automated actions and reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR).).
* The working of the lambda is very simple where we upload the code and we get a number from the lambda. There will be a load balancer which is completely hidden from the user. Then also a service reserve pool which have the resources to run the program which is also hidden from the user.
* If there are excess traffic the lambda will assign many machines from the reserve pool instantaneous.
