* A state full application is one which keeps record of the state of the application in the past like the Data bases, etc.
* The stateless applications are deployed using the deployment abstract and the stateful applications are deployed using the StatefulSet abstract.
* The deployment pods are identical and interchangeable so there is no problem in the replication for the load balancing.
* But the StatefulSet applications like the Database pod cannot be done due to data persistent.
* This is the place where the StatefulSet comes in where it assigns different identity to each replicas and the replicas cannot be interchangeable. The specification will be same but the deletion is not done.

 * As this is the architecture of the StatefulSet application like databases where there will a master node and the worker node. This is due to the fact if there is multiple reads and writes at the same time there will be data inconsistency.
 * The synchronisation is the part where this system excels because when the master pod writes a new data the other worker pods should synchronise with it and if an new pod is added it copies the state or data from the previous pod which will lead to data consistency.
