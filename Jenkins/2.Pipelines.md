- Jenkins Pipeline (or simply "Pipeline" with a capital "P") is a suite of plugins which supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.
- A Continuous Delivery Pipeline is an automated expression of your process for getting software from version control right through to your user and customer.
- Pipeline in the Jenkins provide the extensible tool set for modelling simple to complex delivery pipelines `as code` via `Pipeline Domain-Specific-Language(DSL` syntax.
- The definition of Jenkins pipeline is written into a text file named `Jenkinsfile` just like `Dockerfile` where the `pipeline-as-code` is the concept where we can control the version and do the job.
- A `Jenkinsfile` can be written in two types of syntax:
	1. Declarative
	2. Scripted.
- ![[Pasted image 20240522080527.png]] This is a flow chart which shows how the CD is performed and designed in the Jenkins Pipeline.
- Definitions:
	- Pipeline: A Pipeline is a user-defined model of a CD pipeline. A Pipelineâ€™s code defines your entire build process, which typically includes stages for building an application, testing it and then delivering it. It is the key part of the declarative pipeline syntax.
	- Node: A node is a machine which is the part of the Jenkins environment and is capable of executing pipelines. Node is for the Scripted pipeline syntax.
	- Stage: A stage is a block defines a conceptually distinct subset of tasks performed through the entire Pipeline.
	- Step: A single task fundamentally a step tells Jenkins what to do at a particular point in time.
## Pipeline Syntax:
- Declarative:
```
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                //
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                //
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                //
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- Scripted:
```
node {
    stage('Build') {
        //
    }
    stage('Test') {
        //
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
        //
    }
}
```
- Example pipeline:
```
pipeline {
    agent any
    options {
        skipStagesAfterUnstable()
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'make'
            }
        }
        stage('Test'){
            steps {
                sh 'make check'
                junit 'reports/**/*.xml'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'make publish'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- A pipeline can be created in mainly three ways : `Through Blue Oceans`, ` Through Classic UI`, `In the Source Control Manager(SCM)`. Where the best practises is that the using a `Jenkinsfile` and using the source control like the git.
- In blue ocean and direct `SCM` there is a secure way of handling the `Jenkinsfile` so that the configuration will be source controlled but the direct classical `UI` is not a best practise. The documentation for the pipeline will be inbuilt in the Jenkins itself in the `{JenkinsURL}/pipeline-syntax`
- There are Global variables in the Jenkins which can be used to find information's like `currentBuild` which gives information's like result, display name, etc.
