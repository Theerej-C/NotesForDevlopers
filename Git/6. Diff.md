* `git diff`: Displays the changes made between the current version and the previous version. 
* `git diff --cached`: Displays the changes made between the current version and the version stored in the cache.( staged changes )
* `git diff --staged`: Displays the changes made between the current version and the version that is staged for the next commit. 
* `git diff --interactive`: Allows you to interactively select which changes to include in your next commit.
* The git diff main purpose is to see the changes in the files in the current repo. It checks for the staged one and indexed one.
