- The modules are the building block of the code sharing in the terraform where the code re usability comes to play.
- With Terraform, you can put your code inside of a Terraform module and reuse that module in multiple places throughout your code.
- ![[Pasted image 20240321222814.png]]
- A Terraform module is very simple: any set of Terraform configuration files in a folder is a module. if you run apply directly on a module, itâ€™s referred to as a root module.
- We can use a module in any area where the syntax is the:
```
module "<NAME>" {
source = "<SOURCE>"
[CONFIG ...]
}
// Eg:
module "webserver_cluster" {
source = "../../../modules/services/webserver-cluster"
}
```
* Note that whenever you add a module to your Terraform configurations or modify the source parameter of a module, you need to run the init command before you run plan or apply.
* We had the hard coded name in the files so we need to have the inputs in the modules.
## Inputs and Outputs:
- Terraform, modules can have input parameters, too. To define them, you use a mechanism : input variables.
- We should set the variable name in the modules using the same variables.tf file in the modules and then we need to mention this in the main.tf of the modules:
```
variable "cluster_name" {
description = "The name to use for all the cluster resources"
type = string
}
```
- Then in the place where we use this module use this variable as the input like:
```
module "webserver_cluster" {
source = "../../../modules/services/webserver-cluster"
cluster_name = "webservers-stage"
db_remote_state_bucket = "(YOUR_BUCKET_NAME)"
db_remote_state_key = "stage/data-stores/mysql/terraform.tfstate"
}
```
* The input variables are the API of the module, controlling how it will behave in different environments.
* When we need to set some input variables in the module but it need to be locally that means no other thing can modify it we use the module locals:
```
locals {
http_port = 80
any_port = 0
any_protocol = "-1"
tcp_protocol = "tcp"
all_ips = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
}
```
- To read the value of a local, you need to use a local reference, which uses the following syntax: `local.<NAME>`.
- In Terraform, a module can also return values. Again, you do this using a mechanism you already know: output variables. You can access module output variables using the following syntax: `module.<MODULE_NAME>.<OUTPUT_NAME>`.
```
output "asg_name" {
value = aws_autoscaling_group.example.name
description = "The name of the Auto Scaling Group"
}
// Usage in other file
output "alb_dns_name" {
value = module.webserver_cluster.alb_dns_name
description = "The domain name of the load balancer"
}
```
## Gotchas:
- When creating modules, watch out for these gotchas:
	- File paths
	- Inline blocks
- By default, Terraform interprets the path relative to the current working directory.
- We can use expression known as a path reference, which is of the form `path.<TYPE>` for having the file system path of the module where the expression is defined(Expression in the module folder).
	-  `path.root` - Returns the filesystem path of the root module.
	- `path.module` - Returns the filesystem path of the module where the expression is defined.
	- `path.cwd` - Returns the filesystem path of the current working directory.
