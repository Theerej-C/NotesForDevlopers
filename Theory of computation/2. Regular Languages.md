- As we look into computers are complex machines we cannot directly derive some mathematical proof on it so we use the [[computational model]]
- So first we can look into simple model which is `finite state machine` or `finite automation`
- A computer with a very limited amount of memory like automatic door opening system is an example of finite automata.
- The finite automata and their probabilistic counter part [[Markov chains]] are useful tools when we are attempting to recognize patterns in data.
- The automaton is a singular form of automata which describes a machine which can simulate job done by a human and more.

- Here q2 is the desired state so which ever input attain it is accepted.
