* The namespace is a organising concept where we can use it to organise the resources in a standard manner.
* ![[Pasted image 20240229115417.png|400]]
* The kubernetes-dashboard is the minikube specific. The kube-system is for the system process and we should not edit it.
* The kube-public is public one and available to anyone and has a config map.
* The kube-node-lease is for the heartbeats of the nodes and the lease of the resources of the namespaces.
* We can create a namespace using the `kubectl create namespace NAME`
* We can create a namespace using a configuration file also. The main need of the namespace is the grouping of resources in the namespace.
* The clustering of the resources in a single namespace like default is a problem where we cannot monitor in a effective manner.
* We can create namespaces in the types like the services, deployments, secrets,etc. So we can organise the resources in a namespaces.
* We can avoid the name problems in the deployment, services,etc as sometimes we overwrote the same deployment name.
* We can have staging and development resource sharing using the namespaces.
* We can also limit the resources of the namespaces so we can utilise the resources in good manner.
* There are some downsides also like we cannot use the resources of one namespace from another namespace completely.
* If we have a secret or a config map we should have it in both the namespace if the both refer to same resource also.
* But we can access services from the other namespaces using the namespace name after the service name for example `data_base_service.database`.
* We can add an resource to an namespace by using the flag `--namespace=NAME`. For example: `kubectl apply -f config.yaml --namespace=my-namespace`.
* Or we can just give the namespace a parameter in the config file itself in the metadata part.
* We can use a tool called kubens to change the active namespace in the cluster.
# Ingress:
* If we want to access the application from outside of the cluster we can use the external service and a public IP address. But this is not an convenient method to follow.
* So we use a internal service called the ingress to open a opening in the cluster.
* The config file of the ingress is also like the other components where there will be metadata and the specifications. In the specifications there will be the details of the service name to be forwarded, host name, etc.
* The example for the ingress configuration is :
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: dashboard-ingress
  namespace: kubernetes-dashboard
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"
spec:
  rules:
  - host: dashboard.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Exact  
        backend:
          service:
            name: kubernetes-dashboard
            port: 
              number: 80
```
* The HTTP is the default one where we can change to the HTTPS also.
* We should map the  IP address of the node which will act as an incoming with the domain name  which we provide.
* The ingress cannot operate in a separate manner so we need an ingress controller which is also an another pod in the cluster.
* The controller will evaluate the rules in the config files.
*  There are many ingress controllers are available in the 3rd party. In the minikube the command to enable is `minikube addons enable ingress`.
* This will enable nginx implementation of the ingress controller.
