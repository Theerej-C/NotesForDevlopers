- As we look into computers are complex machines we cannot directly derive some mathematical proof on it so we use the [[computational model]]
- So first we can look into simple model which is `finite state machine` or `finite automation`
- A computer with a very limited amount of memory like automatic door opening system is an example of finite automata.
- The finite automata and their probabilistic counter part [[Markov chains]] are useful tools when we are attempting to recognize patterns in data.
- The automaton is a singular form of automata which describes a machine which can simulate job done by a human and more.

- Here q2 is the desired state so which ever input attain it is accepted.
- A finite automaton has many parts like like set of states and rules to move from one state to another according to the input symbol. We use the transition function which is denoted by δ to define the rules of moving.
- The formal definition for the finite automaton is:
	- A finite automaton is a 5-tuple (Q, Σ, δ, q0, F), where
		1. Q is a finite set called the states,
		2. Σ is a finite set called the alphabet,
		3. δ: Q × Σ−→Q is the transition function,1
		4. q0 ∈ Q is the start state, and
		5. F ⊆ Q is the set of accept states.2
- If A is set of all strings this machine accept then the A is called the language of the machine M and write *L(M) = A*. The machine can accept several strings but it can accept only one language. It can also accept empty language like ∅.
- Example of language is like for previous example A = { w | w contains at least one 1 and an even number of 0 follow the last 1 }. This defines the language of strings accepted by M1 because these strings which are part of language are the one which are accepted.
- A language is called regular language if some finite automaton recognizes it.
- If we consider M as a finite automaton then a string w should follow 3 conditions to be accepted by M with states of $r_0,r_1,r_2,...$ 
	1. $r_0 = q_0$
	2. $\delta(r_i,w_i+1) = r_i+1, for i=0,....,n-1$
	3. $r_n \in F$ 
- Condition 1 says that the machine starts in the start state. Condition 2 says that the machine goes from state to state according to the transition function. Condition 3 says that the machine accepts its input if it ends up in an accept state. We say that M recognizes language A if $A = \{w|\; M\;accepts\;w\}$,

# Designing a finite automaton:
- To design a finite automaton we need to first find the states do that we can assign transitions between them. For example we need to find a automaton for recognizing 001 pattern.
- Here the states are 
	- $q,q_0,q_{00},q_{001}$

## Regular Operations:
- If a language is an object tools to manipulate the object is called as operations and here it is regular operations.
- There are three operations:
	1. Union: $A \cup B = \{x|x\in A\ or\ x \in B\}$    
	2. Concatenation: $A + B = \{xy|x\ \in A\ and \ y\in B\}$
	3. Star: $A^*\ =\{x_1x_2...x_k|k\geq0\ and\ each\ x_i\in\ A\}$
### Theorem 1:
- Statement: The class of regular languages is closed under the union operation. That means $A_1\ and\ A_2$ are regular languages so the $A_1 \ \cup\ A_2$
- So for this we know $A_1\ is\ accepted\ by\ M_1$ and $A_2\ is\ accpted\ by\ M_2$ so we need to prove that M is the machine we need to construct from $M_1\ and\ M_2$.
- It is like running both of the simulation and watching if any of it accepting it. But we need to be careful because when we try to run a input to one machine and we alter the state we cannot rewire the tape. So we need another approach where we use the pairs.
- If $M_1\ has\ k_1$ states and $M_2\ has\ k_2$ pairs then the answer is $k_1\ X\  k_2$ . This product will be states of M each pair as one states.
- Let $M_1\ recognize\ A_1$ where $M_1\ = (Q_1,\Sigma,\delta_1,q_1,F_1)$, $M_2\ recognize\ A_2$ where $M_2\ =\ (Q_2,\Sigma,\delta_2,q_2,F_2)$.
- Let us construct M to recognize $A_1 \cup A_2$ where M = $(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_0,F)$
	1. Q = $\{(r_1,r_2)|r_1\in Q_1\ and\ r_2 \in Q_2\}$, This is a set of cartesian product of set $Q_1$ and $Q_2$.
	2. The $\Sigma = \Sigma_1 \cup \Sigma_2$ 
	3. Let a be a member of $\Sigma$ then:
		1. $\delta((r_1,r_2),a) = (\delta_1,(r_1,a),\delta(r_2,a))$
	4. $q_0$ is a pair of $q_1,q_2$ 
	5. The F is the set of pairs oof either member is an accept state of $M_1\ or\ M_2$ 
		1. F = $\{(r_1,r_2)|r_1\in F_1\ or\ r_2 \in F_2\}$ 
- This proves that finite automaton M can be considered as the automaton which recognizes the $A_1,A_2$

# Non-Determinism:
- Still now we had discussed the machine in a deterministic manner like a step follows the preceding step and we can determine the actions. But the Non-Deterministic machines can have several choices for the next state ahead.
- As Non-Determinism is a generalization of the determinism all the automaton is automatically a Non-Deterministic finite automaton 
- We consider the Deterministic finite automata as (DFA) and other is NFA then the DFA will have exactly one exiting transition arrow but not in the case of NFA.
![[Pasted image 20241027223205.png]]
- Here there can be 0,1 or many transition arrows and also there can be $\epsilon$ which means state can be nothing.
- This is a kind of parallel computing where from state $q_1$ there are 3 ways so 3 machine copies will perform the operation but which operations are waste will die and successful will continue.
