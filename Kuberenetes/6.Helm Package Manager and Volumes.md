* Helm is an package manager for the kubernetes where we can maintain the packages in kubernetes cluster.
* It helps to reduce many manual jobs like searching for the components in the internet for a single service.
* For example if we use a elastic search for logging then we need some stateful set for DB, services, config maps, etc for it. Searching for separate components is tedious. So using the helm we can do this easily.
* Helm is like a docker hub which has collection of yaml files as a chart(term used in helm) where we can access other peoples charts.
* We can use the helm to create a own helm chart also. The database apps and the monitoring apps will have the helm charts for them so we don't need to do the tedious work.
* We can also use the helm as an template engine where we will define some template for the config file. We can define common blueprint for the templates and we can have a placeholder for changing values.
*  We can also use the helm in the place where we deploy same application is deployed in many places like development, production,etc.
* The helm chart will have a directory structure. The`Chart.yaml`is a file which is the meta data of the chart.
* Then the `values.yaml` is the values for the template files in the chart.
* The chart directory in the helm chart where the dependencies of the chart are residing. Where the templates folder is where the real templates are found.
* When we use the `helm install` command then the templates in the chart will be filled with the values in the `values.yaml`.
