* The first component of the configuration file is the meta data section where the details like names, labels, etc are registered.
* The second part is the specification where the specifications are mentioned for the component we are configuring(deployment, services).
* The specification part will differ or have different attributes for different components like deployment and the services.
* The third one is the status part which will be automatically created and calculated by the kubernetes and will be rectified(If not working). 
* The status will be given to the kubernetes from the etcd component of the master node.
* Maximum we store the file in the application code itself like the docker compose file.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```
* This is the example of the service component yaml file. We can modify it a little bit and can use it as the deployment.
