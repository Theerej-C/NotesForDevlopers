* The first component of the configuration file is the meta data section where the details like names, labels, etc are registered.
* The second part is the specification where the specifications are mentioned for the component we are configuring(deployment, services).
* The specification part will differ or have different attributes for different components like deployment and the services.
* The third one is the status part which will be automatically created and calculated by the kubernetes and will be rectified(If not working). 
* The status will be given to the kubernetes from the etcd component of the master node.
* Maximum we store the file in the application code itself like the docker compose file.
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```
* This is the example of the service component yaml file. We can modify it a little bit and can use it as the deployment.
* The deployment configuration file will have a template component in the specification which will be used to have a template of the pod.
* It has its own metadata and the specification.
```
template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.16
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```
* The labels and the selectors are used to connect the deployment to the pod or the deployment to the service etc.
* For example the label in the deployment metadata part will be connected with the selector of the specification part of it or the selector of the service part.
* ![[Pasted image 20240229093840.png|500]]
* The ports are needed to be configured in the both the pods and the services.
* The port of the service is the port of the service itself and the targetPort is the which it needs to forward the port to.
* We can get the total information with the status information using the `kubectl get pod NAME -o yaml`. This will give us a yaml file with our configuration and also extra info like status.
* The status part is automatically added by the kubernetes.
