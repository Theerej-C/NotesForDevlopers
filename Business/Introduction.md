- Business starts when we have a feel when there is a urge for a change.
- The first thing to consider is that when you are good at something do it if you are not at something just outsource it.
- The second thing is the idea where the idea don't need to be original we can have something someone has other so we can combine everything.
- Then the next one is the execution which is the first step to execute your idea. It can be anything like podcast, videos, etc.
- Next think about the revenue side think where are the revenue is going to come. For example if I am an software based company think how to get the money or the revenue side.
- Next step is the purpose. Think about the purpose of the thing you do. Don't be money minded just find the purpose what are going to give to other how to convince others that the thing you do has a purpose.
- And the next main step is that don't look for investors money or anything first start without money like services. Then we can expand it so that we can make money.
## Winning:
- The delay gratification is the first point. We need to have a delayed gratification and wait man. Like spend the initial time for customer satisfaction, grab more clients, etc. 
- The client centric business is the point to success. We need to incorporate the culture around the company where it is customer centric. This ensures the long term goals of the company.
- The next point is the luck. Luck is not the automatic there are some cheats. The first one is persistence and hook to it. The next force is define what is success for you that means look for the goal. The next point is to take risk not all the workers are gaining everything.
- When we work hard we get luck is the biggest lie. That means in the process of the business growth hard work is different. But the risk is the thing which will give us advantage.
- We need to have a mindset that everything is lost there is no problem I am persistent and the loss doesn't matter to me. Accept every loss and learn from it.
- Wait wait wait first build a brand then make money. Don't rush everything just wait.
## Lose:
- The thing to note is that success is not always the success. The key to success is the accepting the failure.
- Don't let things own you is the main principle. We need to mark which are the things which is the liability and get rid of it.
- Let the short term ego go. This doesn't mean the ego for business is lost. This means don't allow short term ego to be going on. Like buying an car so that other thing you are successful is the worst thing. Just let others think you are losing.
- Just accept the losing. Getting a D in a business is take your time don't always want a A. Internalize the ego just don't allow others decide what you do. They can judge no issue just don't what you do.
## Mind Map:
- First stop the business plan because to traditional approach can kill the business. Just do a mind map which can be expanded.
- The base core layer is the hobby what you love to do. Then the next outer layer is the business. From the business we can mark the points like what we had done and what are responses. Like when we start a you tube channel then the addons are the network we grow, the reach we got, etc. This include the application building, marketing, etc.

## Purpose:
- When we don't have a purpose we will work for others purposes. So the main point is the purpose which we need to concentrate. 
- The concept of group comes when there is a common purpose for the whole culture inside the company. There should be give without take mentality among the culture inside the company.
- Then think about what problem are you going to solve. What is the important problem you are going to solve in the future with your business.
- Then matching the purpose with what we do daily. Like we need to match every moves we make to match the purpose of ours.
- And also don't think in selfish just look for other like minded guys.
## Cofounder:
- The starting point is that what you love to do and what you hate to do. We need to take the part of what we love to do.
- And we need to look to a person who has the passion of what you hate to do. But remember about the equity. 
- And also look for the person who has the same moral values as you which is the most important thing. Know everything about that person so that you can predict everything and also just choose a guy who will respect you give you space, etc. 
- Just look for the person who wants the work more not the money which means morally correct individuals.
- Then post it. Just ask people what you are looking for. Just post it anywhere or just talk with people so that you can find a person.

## Selling:
- Sell the sizzle not the steak. Which means don't sell the product as a product just sell it in a manner how it solves the problem. The smell of the steak is the selling point where the explanation of the taste of steak is waste of time. 
- Just pick the people who are the potential one which increase our business like apple would chose just 3500 people who are the important one who talks about the product.
- Then understand the customer where the customer management is the key part. First listen and research in the customer side. Just listen with the customer.
- Analyze do they need you, then understand the person in a way that do you like them. If everything goes well the deal will happen eventually.
- Just think in a long term manner not in a small mindset just see the long term benefits of the customer. Make contact with the customer like send them something, send free services. Be relentless and approach them constantly.
- Just build relationship with the people where they should think that you care about them.

## Market:
- Marketing is about really experimenting and connecting with the people which is like branding. The 50 percentage of the marketing cost will wasted but we need to have a long time goal.
- First thing is to understand who is your customer then only we can have a lead in the business. 
- The next thing is the stair case philosophy which means a stair case it is like be a step by step process. And also it is like do what ever there to market your thing like doing some shitty and costly purchases by your company so that the newspaper will cover your story.
- Marketing is not promoting by ourself just reach out to the marketing expert or any partner or any organization. The sales and the marketing are the two combined things.
- Then the third thing is the system like email, social media, PR, branding, events. But we need to have a good system which is consistent and prepare for the systematic approach.
- Marketing should be fun guys that means if you don't want to go inside a camera then no issues write blogs. You should be comfortable in the marketing.

## PR:
- The PR is like targeted thing where we need to targeting on specific thing. You shouldn't consider your ego like you only be there and not here. We should reach out to every extreme.
- The next thing is journalist are lazy so we should give everything just give them what they wanted. The photos, sentences, etc we need to send it to the press so that it is easy for them to do their work.
- If you have huge fund for marketing then there is no problem but of you are starting don't go for large PR but research about the journalist who give you a lead.
- Then learn to be disciplined because the image is very important that means don't try to fool the press. 

## Investor:
- If we want to get a investor in a wrong way then we will have a new boss and it will disaster. If we want a early investment then know the person who you are getting the money.
- But the initial investment investor will always interfere in the process of yourself where he wants to involve in the business so that they can guarantee their money is worth it.
- The first person you should consider is family and friends. Because they know you and your effort. But tell them the truth that they can loss money be transparent. Just get the recommendation from a friend or any.
- Then the next guy is the person who you wants to work with you. This guy will work with you because he also have the same spirit.
- Then the third is the angel investor who is the investor who has the money who you want as an investor. But don't ask for money but just ask help. So that they will respect you. You need to set the mindset of the investor that if they don't invest they are missing something.
- Then the fourth type is VC (Venture Capitalist) where there are some points. First know how they make the money. Then see who they invested before the business which is like your one because there is huge chance for you. Then try to connected to the other company which got investment of the VC you want.
- Then the fifth method is that funds from brand partners or customers where we can get the money for the expansions and like that.
- But the main point is just ask do you want money?. Just try at your fullest to go without the funds. First start with the services. Where the crowd funding is also a option.

## Sponsorships:
- Understand why sponsorship happens that is the first point. The first point is value returns which is what is returned to them when they sponsor you.
- The second thing is the emotional sale where we emotionally connect with the sponsor. Understand the brand that is the main key where we need to understand the business.
- Understanding the brand value is also the important thing. We need to invest time where the brand value is the important part.
- Research about the people in the brand who are the controlling guys so that you can have a good relationship.
- We need to work with the people who work with the brand like agents so that we can have a peer pressure in the brand.

## Brand:
- First thing first the value of the brand is the important thing. What do we care about? What are the non negotiable? Understanding the personality of ourself. 
- We need to scale the image of ourself where the other person should be eager to invest in us.
- We need to take the personal brand very seriously. We need to have a personal value where the brand creation starts from here.
- We can use the reference of other brands so that we can grow ourself and create our brand. Like Nike brand theirs using the Michael Jordan.
- Then the next thing is leadership brand where there is a great leader like Steve jobs. The leading kinds of the brand is good thing to have.
- There are many risks are also there like when we use the reference model and if the actor or celebrity do something wrong it also affect us. Then in leadership model if the leader left it will make us weak.
- Then then next thing is learn to say no where we have a bad relationship. Or the brand is the problem then there should be no.

## Hiring:
- If our business has a purpose and the people who you hire has the same purpose then there is no need for management.
- Just check the social media or history where we need to find the purpose of the employee so that we can have a better things.
- Then it is better to give the equity to the employee. When we give the equity then they will believe the company so that there is increase in the retention of employee.
- We need to grow a business using growing the people and the culture. When we change the value of the business the result is the employee leaving the company.
- We need to invent continuously and we need to continuously integrate or else we will be outdated. 
- We need to allow or force the people and us to be a specialist not a generalized manner. And we need to have a system and system should be with the specialist.

## Firing:
- We need to learn to fire people that means it is not good but it can be necessary. Because someone can be liable to the company so we need to fire them after we give them some chance.
- If the rating is 1 and 2 we need to get rid of them. But we need to appreciate the 9 and 10. We also need to move the 7 and 8 so that they reach the 9 and 10
- When we allow the 7 and 8 then the 9 and 10 will leave. So we need to device the plan like we need to move them to 9 and 10 or else we need to fire them.
