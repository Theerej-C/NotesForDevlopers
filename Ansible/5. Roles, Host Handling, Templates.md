- Roles are the important feature of the ansible which minimise the cluttering of the code in a single file. This make easier to split the files into tasks and not into plays so we can use as many as we want in a single play using a single task file and mentioning it in the play.
- To get a roles structure we need to set up `roles` directory in the base of the main file for example the file which uses the roles.
- Then inside the roles we must make directories on the names of specific roles for example in main file if we mention `roles` name as `web_servers` then the folder name should also same. Then inside that folder again create a sub folder named as `tasks` and then inside that `tasks` create `main.yml` file which will hold the tasks.

- The above format is the exactly how we want to create the structure. Then in the `main.yml` just paste the tasks not the play like for `db_server:
```
- name: install mariadb server on CentOS
  tags: db,mariadb,centos
  yum:
    name: mariadb-server
    state: latest
  when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS"  
- name: Start mariadb service on centos
  tags: db,mariadb,centos
  service:
    name: mariadb
    state: started 
    enabled: yes
  when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS"
```
- Then inside the main playbook in the main directory add the tasks using the `roles` keyword and the name of the role like:
```
---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: install updates (centos)
      tags: always
      yum:
        update_only: yes
        update_cache: yes
      when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS"
    - name: install updates (Ubuntu)
      tags: always
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
      when: ansible_distribution == "Ubuntu"
- hosts: all
  become: true
  roles:
    - base
- hosts: workstations
  become: true
  roles:
    - workstations
- hosts: web_servers
  become: true
  roles:
    - web_servers
- hosts: db_server
  become: true
  roles:
    - db_server
```
- This will run the roles separately in the tasks. The points to remember is the name of the directory should be same as roles and there should be at least `tasks` sub folder and addition to that there can be many sub folders for other features in ansible. Then if we use a file in the task of an role then the file should be in the `files` folder inside the `roles/ROLE_NAME` folder.
## Host Variables and Handlers:
- These are the variables which we can use to reduce the cluttering of the code and store the repeated words in variables. To do that we need to store the variables in the directory named as `host_vars` and the file name for each host should be their IP or host name or DNS name `.yml`.
- So the syntax of the variables are simple `yml` like `apache_service: httpd`. and mentioning the variable is also simple `"{{ apache_service }}"` in the playbooks.
-  As we had previously seen that using  the change in the variable we can trigger a restart but that is not efficient. Because if we continuously change the state then if one has no change then total no change so we use handlers. The handlers are the separate block of play which will triggered if any one of the place which mention it changes. The `notify` is the keyword to use which will tell which handler to be triggered 
- For example consider this play
```
- name: Change the file for httpd
  tags: file,httpd,apache
  lineinfile:
    path: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
    regexp: '^ServerAdmin'
    line: ServerAdmin somebody@somebody.com
  when: ansible_distribution == "CentOS"
  notify: apache_restart
```
- So the notify will call the `apache_restart` which will be in the `handlers` folder and file name is `main.yml`. The handlers folder should be in the `roles/NAME_OF_THE_ROLE` folder. The important point is that the name of the play should be same as the name in the notify.
```
- name: apache_restart
  tags: httpd,centos
  service:
    name: "{{ apache_service }}"
    state: restarted
```

## Templates:
- Templates are the files which can be send to all the host with modifications we need for example the `sshd_config` file which is the control file of the `ssh` service. So we can use the template config file from our machine to configure the server file and modify it.
- For example to add `AllowUsers` variable in the files of the servers to allow specific users through ssh we use the template method. First create a folder named as templates in the which ever role we want like `base`. Then inside the templates folder create templates for separate distributions by copying the already present template files from the `/etc/ssh/sshs_config`.
- We can use the `scp` tool to transfer that file from the servers. `scp IP_ADDRESS:/etc/ssh/sshd_conf FILE_NAME.j2`. The `j2` extension is the extension ansible uses for templates. Then edit the template file as we need like
```
AllowUsers {{ ssh_users }}
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key
#HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key
HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key
# Ciphers and keying
#RekeyLimit default none
```
- As we can see the `ssh_users` which will be in the `host_vars` directory under the specific host like Ubuntu. Then we need to create a play to template this file to the servers where the `template` is a module in the ansible. 
```
- name: templating the ssh files
  tags: ssh
  template:
    src: "{{ ssh_template_file }}"
    dest: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    owner: root 
    group: root 
    mode: 0644
  notify: restart_sshd
```
- As the name of the file is also in the `host_vars` files for the separate files.
