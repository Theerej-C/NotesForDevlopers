- The Jenkins is an CI/CD platform which is the process of Continuous Integeration and Continuous Deployment. Where the CI means multiple people working in the same project in an continuous manner.
- Where the CD means we can continuously deploy the application in the server. As there are many tools the Jenkins has an unique advantage like plugins (More than 100 plugins). 
- To use the Jenkins we need the java in the machine to use the Jenkins. Then the daemon will start and the admin page will be in the port 8080. Use the install the default plugins so that no problem in there.
- Jenkins is an automation platform which allows us to build, test and deploy software's in an automated manner using pipelines. We can automate anything using the Jenkins and then it provides a Web GUI to do these things. 
## Best Practises:
- Automated job definition which means jenkins can automatically create, update, delete jobs according to the repositories it identifies in our Software configuration management.
- The organisation folders is an way by the Jenkins which automatically include the new repository created by an team member into the multi line pipe lining.
- Jenkins pipeline is a suite of plugins that supports implementation and integrating CD  pipelines into Jenkins.
- We can use the agents instead of controllers to build where it is safe and secure. And we can configure the Jenkins so that it will show the errors to the right person and don't disturb others.
- The Jenkins controller plays an crucial role as a central resource which needs management for optimal performance. We should not disable the security of the controller which is default in the jenkins.
## Projects:
- The projects or the jobs which is the thing Jenkins uses to perform its work. There are several types of projects:
	- Pipeline
	- Multibranch pipeline
	- Organisation folders
	- Freestyle
	- Multi-configuration
	- Maven
	- External job.
