* A state full application is one which keeps record of the state of the application in the past like the Data bases, etc.
* The stateless applications are deployed using the deployment abstract and the stateful applications are deployed using the StatefulSet abstract.
* The deployment pods are identical and interchangeable so there is no problem in the replication for the load balancing.
* But the StatefulSet applications like the Database pod cannot be done due to data persistent.
* This is the place where the StatefulSet comes in where it assigns different identity to each replicas and the replicas cannot be interchangeable. The specification will be same but the deletion is not done.

 * As this is the architecture of the StatefulSet application like databases where there will a master node and the worker node. This is due to the fact if there is multiple reads and writes at the same time there will be data inconsistency.
 * The synchronisation is the part where this system excels because when the master pod writes a new data the other worker pods should synchronise with it and if an new pod is added it copies the state or data from the previous pod which will lead to data consistency.
 * The stateful set pods will get fixed ordered names where the other pods like deployment pods will get the random hashes for the names.
 * The stateful set pods replicas creation follows an order where the creation of the first one followed by second where if the first one is not created then the second is also not. Where the deletion will be reversed order where the last is deleted first.
 * There will be an load balance for the stateful application also like the deployment applications.

# Services:
* The services are a object in the kubernetes which is used for specific purposes where the main reason is the pods in the cluster will get their own IP address but the pods are ephemeral which means gets destroyed easily.
* So we need an object named service where the IP will be stable and doesn't deleted. Then the load balancing is an additional feature where the services can used to load balance.
* It is helpful in the loose coupling of the pods and their properties. This is inside and the outside the cluster also.
* When a service need to communicate with an pod it uses the selector to get the information of which pod to communicate. Where the selector will be getting information from the labels. 
* The target port attribute in the config file of the service will be the port which the service forwards its traffic to.
* The kubernetes will create endpoints object for the service to keep track of the pods which are the endpoints of the service.

* Their are many types of the services are there:
	* ### ClusterIP:
		* It is the default service in the kubernetes which is assigned when we don't assign an type.
		* This type of services are used in the normal microservice architectures where there are some databases and some end points.
		* When there are multiple endpoints for the single service the ClusterIP is used in that space.
